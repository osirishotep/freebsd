***** Release RC0  1/4/2012 ***************************************************

New features/limitations-

-Port of LIS 2.1 with FreeBSD support code from Citrix, drivers are linked with
 Kernel (future drivers will be loadable), port has not been refactored to meet
 BSD coding standards for kernel code.
 
-SCSI device driver functional, but support for scatter-gather lists is not
 implemented-Fast IDE support has not been added-still using emulated IDE
 support
 
-Network storage device support has been added

-Storage and networking devices only support one controller- waiting on a
 resolution from Microsoft to enable persistent ordering for multiple
 controllers
  
-Hyper-V bus has been ported with support code from Citrix to handle clock
 synchronization between guest and host. Clock synchronization and heartbeat
 logic have been moved to two drivers, respectively- this separation is part
 of the initial steps of a refactoring the Hyper-V bus driver from the,
 LIS 2.1 codebase.
 
Bug fixes-
