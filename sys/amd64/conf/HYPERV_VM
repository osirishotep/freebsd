# Adaptive locks rely on a lock-free pointer read to determine the run state
# of the thread holding a lock when under contention; under a virtualisation
# system, the thread run state may not accurately reflect whether the thread
# (or rather its host VCPU) is actually executing.  As such, disable this
# optimisation.
